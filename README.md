## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript - DOM Manipulation & Form Validation
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
Age Calculator is my second project in Frontend Mentor. I guess this is my second time trying to build something from the ground up with JavaScript, together with HTML and CSS. Throughout the journey, my key takeaway is:
1. how to do custom form validation using JavaScript instead of HTML built-in attributes.
2. how to do DOM Manipulation using JavaScript - add class for styling using classList.add and classList.remove.
3. how to work with SASS and set up sass compiler with gulp.
4. gaining understanding working with HTML input element.
5. problem solving by decomposing bigger problems into tiny manageable chunks.


### Continued development
- Adding testing framework.
- Adjust style to match my preferences.
- continue exploring SASS/
- continue exploring JavaScript and Js Framework.

### Useful resources
- [Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - I read through this MDN guide on client-side form validation and gain inspiration on how to tackle issues.
- [ChatGPT](Chat.openai.com) - a good debugging tools - although it is not 100% accurate, it did provide me with some inspiration to tackle an issue from another perspectives, learning to leverage the power of AI increasing my efficiency.
